# Bingo Refactoring Kata

Can you spot any code smell? We think you should be able to find

- Primitive Obsession
- Data Clumps
- Missing Polymorphism

Use Parallel Change to improve this code by introducing a Cell and Coordinate class.

First introduce the Cell class: focus on parallel change of the internal datastructure.

Second introduce the Coordinate class: focus on parallel change of the public API of the BingoBoard class.

As you refactor, lean on the tests. There are two versions of the unit tests. Take note of which of them is easier to understand and update as you refactor.
